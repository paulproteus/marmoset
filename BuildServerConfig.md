Initial configuration for a build server can be downloaded through the instructor course view. They can be further configured with the following properties, which should be placed in the config file downloaded from the submit server.

# Configuration Properties #
| **Property Key** | **Default** | **Description** |
|:-----------------|:------------|:----------------|
| `supportedCourses` | Required | A comma-separated list of keys (generated by the submit server) that specifies which courses this build server may build. |
| `build.directory` | `build` | Local directory where projects will be built and run. |
| `run.student.tests` | `false` | Whether to run student test code during the testing phase. |
| `hostname` | Optional | Hostname of the build server. If not set, the build server will try and determine it at runtime. |
| `build.server.root` | Optional | Root directory where the build server is running. If not set, the build server will attempt to determine this at runtime. |
| `test.files.directory` | `testfiles` | Directory where test files (from the test setup) should be extracted. |
| `test.SetupCache.directory` | `setupCache` | Directory where the test setup jar file is cached. It must not be in the build directory or in the test files directory, because if it were it would be accessible to student code. |
| `log.directory` | `log` | Directory where the `buildserver.log` file is stored. If set to `console`, logging will be output to the console. |
